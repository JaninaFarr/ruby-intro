# ruby 3-arrays.rb

# Arrays are lists of things

#puts favorite_foods

#puts mixed_arrays

# shopping_list = [["tofu", "taco", "oats"], ["cucumber", "tomato", "peach"]]
# puts shopping_list [1][2]

# Accessing the array
favorite_foods =["tacos", "tofu", "Nico's Tofu Scamble"]
 #puts favorite_foods

# Add to the array
favorite_foods.push("sushi")
favorite_foods = favorite_foods +["burger"]
