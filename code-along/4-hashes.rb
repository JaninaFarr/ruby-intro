# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 4-hashes.rb

# Hashes are lists of *key-value pairs*
# me = {
#     "name"=> "Janina",
#     "location" => "Chicago"
#     }
# puts me

# Accessing data from the hash
me = {
    "name"=> "Janina",
    "location" => {"city" => "Chicago","state" => "IL"},
    "status" => "here"}
puts me["name"]
puts me



# More Complex Hashes
